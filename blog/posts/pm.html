<h1>On Product Management</h1>

<h2>How I Work</h2>
<ol>
    <li>I talk to my customers frequently and aim to fully <b>understand</b> their problems. I try to feel the pain firsthand (by replicating it if I can) whenever possible to better empathize with them.</li>
    <li>I always answer these three questions when working on features: What are you building? Who is it for? Why are we building it?</li>
    <li>
        Roadmapping is not only important, it's basically the job. The next quarter should be well planned and I try to always have a rough idea of 2-3 quarters out. I like to have public roadmaps that inform customers about common/big asks. Something like "Now, Next, Future" is fine for that. A public voting forum is even better so you can easily see things your customers want.
