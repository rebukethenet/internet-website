<h1>On Product Management</h1>

<h2>My Tenets</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Talk to your customers and <b>understand</b> their problems. Feel the pain firsthand (i.e. replicate) whenever possible to better empathize.</li>
    <li>You should always know: What are you building? Who is it for? Why are we building it?</li>
    <li>
        Have a public roadmap. Something like "Now, Next, Future" is fine. A public voting forum is even better.
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://feedback.render.com">Render.com's public roadmap and feature voting</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap">GitHub's using their own project tracking</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://trello.com/b/ZnTQyumQ/slack-platform-roadmap">Slack uses Trello</a></li>
        </ul>
