<h1>On Product Management</h1>

<h2>My Tenets</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Talk to your customers and <b>understand</b> their problems. Feel the pain firsthand (i.e. replicate) whenever possible to better empathize.</li>
    <li>You should always know: What are you building? Who is it for? Why are we building it?</li>
</ol>
